# NumberWall

NumberWall is a game to aid learning numbers in various languages. The player is shown the text for a number 0-100 in their target language and then ten options as to the number it could represent. The aim is to get as many right in one minute as possible. The game retains high scores (only locally on the device) so each time you play you can see if you did better than last time.

If you are unsure as to the answer, the game will help you after ten seconds by removing five of the options and a further three options after another three seconds. 

The game runs entirely locally on your device, no log in account is needed, no data is saved in the cloud. 

Pre built binaries of this game will be available from https://liamgh.itch.io/numberwall and the Android Play Store.
